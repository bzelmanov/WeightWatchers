The assignment was done at Eclipse SDK Version: Mars.2 (4.5.2) Build id: M20160212-1500.

The folder structure is still original, the folder with copies and screenshots is a parent one, "_READFIRST_Assignment_Independent_with_copies_of_scripts".

It might be require to change a path for a particular file.

Please note that I didn't enter into the files any extra/development information, comment, etc... which is not necessary in this case.

Thanks for checking my work out!
